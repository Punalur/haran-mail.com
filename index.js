I know this will happen. As I am quite flexible, I used to renew for few of my friends even before they pay which is not at all quite common.
To avoid this kind of issues with few clients, I activate their account only after receiving the cash.

If you want, I could do same with you too. People usually ask to activate and they say will pay later.
But after several days and weeks of follow-up, they pay very late and unfortunately, they start counting from that payment date.
Delibrately or by mistake they forget I activated their account before.

So to avoid, this I regularly keep account of all transaction and activation.
